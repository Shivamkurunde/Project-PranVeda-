# 🔴 Firebase Authentication Issue

## ❌ Problem: CONFIGURATION_NOT_FOUND

The Firebase project `pranveda-new-original` is not configured for email/password authentication.

---

## 🔧 Solution: Enable Email/Password Authentication

### **Option 1: Enable via Firebase Console** (Recommended)

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. **Select Project**: `pranveda-new-original`
3. **Navigate to**: Authentication → Sign-in method
4. **Enable**: Email/Password provider
5. **Save**

### **Option 2: Use the Frontend Sign-Up Form**

The frontend uses Firebase Web SDK which might handle configuration differently.

1. **Make sure backend is running**: Port 5000 ✅
2. **Make sure frontend is running**: Port 8082 ✅
3. **Go to**: `http://localhost:8082/auth/signup`
4. **Fill the form** and click "Create Account"

This should work even if the REST API doesn't!

---

## ✅ **IMMEDIATE WORKAROUND: Use Google Sign-In**

Since Google OAuth is already configured, use it instead:

1. **Go to**: `http://localhost:8082/auth/signup`
2. **Click**: "Sign up with Google" button
3. **Select your Google account**
4. **Done!** ✅

This creates a user immediately without needing email/password!

## 🔍 What's Happening?

The error `CONFIGURATION_NOT_FOUND` means:
- Firebase project exists ✅
- API key is valid ✅
- BUT Email/Password provider is **not enabled** in Firebase Console ❌
