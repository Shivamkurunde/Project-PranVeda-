# ✅ Frontend Import Fixes Complete

## 🎉 STATUS: FIXED

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Issue:** Import path errors after frontend reorganization  
**Solution:** Updated all import paths to match new feature-based structure

---

## 🔧 What Was The Problem?

After reorganizing the frontend into a feature-based architecture, we moved:
- `src/hooks/useFirebaseAuth.tsx` → `src/features/auth/hooks/useFirebaseAuth.tsx`

But many files were still trying to import from the old path:
```typescript
❌ import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/useFirebaseAuth';
```

This caused Vite errors:
```
Failed to resolve import "@/hooks/useFirebaseAuth" - Does the file exist?
```

---

## ✅ Files Fixed

### **Within Auth Feature** (use relative paths)
1. ✅ `features/auth/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
   - Changed: `@/hooks/useFirebaseAuth` → `../hooks/useFirebaseAuth`

2. ✅ `features/auth/components/AuthLayout.tsx`
   - Changed: `../../hooks/useFirebaseAuth` → `../hooks/useFirebaseAuth`

3. ✅ `features/auth/pages/SignIn.tsx`
   - Changed: `@/hooks/useFirebaseAuth` → `../hooks/useFirebaseAuth`

4. ✅ `features/auth/pages/SignUp.tsx`
   - Changed: `@/hooks/useFirebaseAuth` → `../hooks/useFirebaseAuth`

### **Outside Auth Feature** (use module export)
5. ✅ `pages/Landing.tsx`
   - Changed: `@/hooks/useFirebaseAuth` → `@/features/auth`

---

## 📁 Correct Import Pattern

### **Files INSIDE `features/auth/`:**
Use relative paths:
```typescript
// From features/auth/components or features/auth/pages
import { useAuth } from '../hooks/useFirebaseAuth';
```

### **Files OUTSIDE `features/auth/`:**
Use the module export:
```typescript
// From anywhere else in the app
import { useAuth } from '@/features/auth';
```

## 🚀 Result

Status: 200 OK
